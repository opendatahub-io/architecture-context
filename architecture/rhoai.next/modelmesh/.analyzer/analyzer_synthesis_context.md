### configuration_lifecycle

- **Question:** What lifecycle, command, probes, and deployment configuration surround this entrypoint?
  **Expected signal:** main command, startup path, probe, signal handling, or workload mapping
  **Candidate:** `Dockerfile`:154 (Dockerfile:CMD)
  **Status:** candidate; **Limitations:** candidate location only; source inspection is required to establish the relationship
- **Question:** What lifecycle, command, probes, and deployment configuration surround this entrypoint?
  **Expected signal:** main command, startup path, probe, signal handling, or workload mapping
  **Candidate:** `Dockerfile.konflux`:65 (Dockerfile.konflux:CMD)
  **Status:** candidate; **Limitations:** candidate location only; source inspection is required to establish the relationship
### services

- **Question:** Which container listener, probe, and service mapping expose this workload?
  **Expected signal:** container port, probe, service account, or lifecycle configuration
  **Candidate:** `config/base/deployment.yaml`:14 (model-mesh)
  **Status:** candidate; **Limitations:** candidate location only; source inspection is required to establish the relationship
- **Question:** Which workload owns this Service and does its target port match a runtime listener?
  **Expected signal:** selector, target deployment, port mapping, or listener
  **Candidate:** `config/base/service.yaml`:14 (model-mesh)
  **Status:** candidate; **Limitations:** candidate location only; source inspection is required to establish the relationship
